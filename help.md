# Roll the Dice – Backgammon

## Help (Gameplay)

## What this app does

This app is a dice + score + history companion for playing backgammon on a **real board**.  
It rolls dice fairly, tracks match and game progress, and records results to player profiles.

It **does not enforce legal moves**. You play on the physical board; the app tracks rolls and results.

## Gameplay flow

### 1) New Match / Select Players

- Pick Player 1 and Player 2 (type a new name or select an existing profile).
- Choose colors (Red / White). Use *Swap Colors* if players switch sides.
- Choose match length.

*Nothing is recorded until you press **Start***.

---

### 2) Start Match / Start Game

- Tap **Start** to begin.
- Players and colors are locked for the game.
- Current game totals reset.

---

### 3) Opening roll (single die) and turn order

- Each player rolls a single die to decide who starts.
- Turns alternate during this opening roll.
- Highest single die starts (ties reroll).

---

### 4) Keep playing until the end

- Roll when appropriate for your board play.
- Rolls add to the current game totals.
- The app does not enforce moves or turns beyond the opening-roll alternation.

---

### 5) Record the winner (S / G / B)

- When the game ends on the physical board, the winning player records the win using **S / G / B**.
- This saves the game and updates both players’ stats.

*If you don’t record a win, the game is not saved.*

---

### 6) Additional games per match length

- Repeat play and record the winner until the match length is satisfied.
- Review match results when the match ends.

---

### 7) OK (Reset)

- **OK** clears the current match/game state and returns to **New Match / Select Players**.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Game didn’t save**: the winner must record it using **S / G / B**.
- **Stats didn’t change**: same cause — only recorded wins update stats.
- **Main screen doesn’t rotate**: gameplay is locked to portrait to prevent accidental rotation while playing.
